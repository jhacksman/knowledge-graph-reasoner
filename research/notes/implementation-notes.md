# Implementation Notes

## Core Architecture

### 1. Graph-based Knowledge System
- Iterative graph expansion framework
- Nodes represent concepts/knowledge
- Edges represent relationships
- Uses scale-free network properties
- Maintains modularity and bridging nodes

### 2. LLM Integration
- Venice.ai API with deepseek-r1-671b model
- Used for:
  - Generating new concepts
  - Establishing relationships
  - Formulating subsequent prompts
  - Reasoning over existing knowledge

### 3. Key Components
- Graph Database/Structure
  - Store nodes (concepts) and edges (relationships)
  - Support for metadata and attributes
  - Efficient querying capabilities
- Prompt Management System
  - Template system for structured prompts
  - Markers for reasoning (<|thinking|> tags)
  - Dynamic prompt generation based on graph state
- Knowledge Extraction Pipeline
  - Parse LLM outputs
  - Extract entity-relationship pairs
  - Merge new knowledge into existing graph
- Graph Analysis Tools
  - Compute centrality measures
  - Track network metrics
  - Analyze path lengths and connectivity

### 4. Core Processes
- Iterative Reasoning Loop:
  a. Generate questions based on current graph state
  b. Get LLM response with reasoning
  c. Extract structured knowledge
  d. Update graph
  e. Analyze metrics and structure
  f. Generate next question
