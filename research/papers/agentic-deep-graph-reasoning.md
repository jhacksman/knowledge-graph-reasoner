# Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning Yields Self-Organizing Knowledge Networks

## Abstract

This work introduces a framework for recursive graph expansion that demonstrates self-organizing intelligence-like behavior through iterative reasoning without predefined ontologies, external supervision, or centralized control. The system employs the Venice.ai API with the deepseek-r1-671b model for dynamic knowledge graph construction and maintenance.

## Key Components

### Graph Evolution Metrics
- Average shortest path length (stabilizes ~4.5-5.0)
- Graph diameter (stabilizes ~16-18)
- Louvain modularity for community detection
- Degree assortativity coefficient
- Global transitivity
- Bridge node persistence

### Knowledge Integration Process
1. Initial rapid structuring phase
2. Episodic emergence of new bridge nodes
3. Stabilization periods
4. Dynamic restructuring phases

### Bridge Node Management
- Tracks persistence of interdisciplinary connections
- Monitors both transient and stable connectors
- Identifies core concepts that maintain bridging roles

## Technical Implementation

   - Model: deepseek-r1-671b
   - Structured prompt management
   - Response parsing

2. Graph Database Layer
   - NetworkX-based implementation
   - Dynamic node/edge management
   - Metadata support
   - Efficient querying

3. Knowledge Extraction Pipeline

   - Deduplication handling

4. Analysis Module

## Methodology

The system operates through an iterative process:
1. Generate questions based on current graph state
2. Get LLM response with explicit reasoning
3. Extract structured knowledge
4. Update graph structure
5. Analyze metrics and structure
6. Generate next question

## Results

The framework demonstrates:
- Stable community formation through Louvain modularity
