# Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning Yields Self-Organizing Knowledge Networks

## Abstract

This work introduces a framework for recursive graph expansion that demonstrates self-organizing intelligence-like behavior through iterative reasoning without predefined ontologies, external supervision, or centralized control. The system employs deep graph reasoning to dynamically construct and maintain knowledge networks that exhibit emergent properties of scale-free organization and modular structure.

## 1. Introduction

The development of systems capable of autonomous knowledge discovery and organization represents a fundamental challenge in artificial intelligence. Traditional approaches often rely on predefined ontologies or supervised learning, limiting their ability to discover novel relationships and adapt to emerging knowledge domains. This work presents a framework for agentic deep graph reasoning that enables continuous, self-directed knowledge expansion through recursive iteration.

## 2. Results and Discussion

### 2.1 Basic Analysis of Recursive Graph Growth

The evolution of network metrics demonstrates structured self-organization:
- Average shortest path length stabilizes around 4.5-5.0
- Graph diameter stabilizes at 16-18
